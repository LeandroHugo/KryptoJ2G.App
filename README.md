## *A New Era Of Fintech Payments*

## Project Backstory 🏙️

**Welcome aboard!** You're the lead developer at an exciting startup, building a revolutionary platform - KryptoJobs2Go! This innovative application acts as a bridge connecting customers with fintech professionals. The real game-changer? Our customers can instantly pay the professionals they hire with cryptocurrency! 💷

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the KryptoJobs2Go application to facilitate instantaneous cryptocurrency payments. Assume the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer to develop and test the code enabling crypto payments to hired fintech professionals.

## Your Toolbox 🧰

Your journey will revolve around two Python files within the starter folder:

1. `krypto_jobs.py` - This file hosts the code associated with our application's web interface, compatible with the Streamlit library. You'll be enhancing this file with your codes for the challenge.

2. `crypto_wallet.py` - This script houses the Ethereum transaction functions you've created throughout the module. By cleverly importing this into the `krypto_jobs.py` file, you'll empower your application to automate the tasks of generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain called Ganache.

## Project Goals 🎯

* Generate a new Ethereum account instance using Ganache's provided mnemonic seed phrase.

* Fetch and display the account balance of your Ethereum account address.

* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, paying a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.

* Digitally sign a transaction paying a KryptoJobs2Go candidate and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

To validate your successful transaction, you'll take screenshots of the blockchain transaction details on Ganache and add them to your README.md file on your GitHub repository.

## Mission Steps 🪜

The mission can be broken down into three phases:

* Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the KryptoJobs2Go Application

* Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction

* Inspect the Transaction on Ganache

### Phase 1: Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the KryptoJobs2Go Application 📚

This phase involves integrating wallet operations into the application by importing several functions from the `crypto_wallet.py` script into `krypto_jobs.py`. For details on this, please check the specific steps under the "Instructions" section in the project prompt.

### Phase 2: Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction 🖊️

In this phase, you'll calculate a fintech professional’s wage, in ether, based on the worker’s hourly rate and the number of hours they work for a customer. You'll then enable a customer to send a transaction that pays the worker, authorizing the transaction with their digital signature. Check the project prompt for a detailed breakdown of the steps.

### Phase 3: Inspect the Transaction 🕵️‍♀️

Now, it's time to put everything together and test your newly minted application with the integrated Ethereum wallet. Send a test transaction using the application's web interface, then look up the resulting transaction in Ganache. The project prompt contains an in-depth guide on the steps to follow.

## Final Submission 📨

Once you've completed the mission, upload the files to your GitHub repository and submit the link to Bootcamp Spot.

Remember, the success of KryptoJobs2Go's disruptive potential rests in your hands! Best of luck, and happy coding!
